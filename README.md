# Larus, a template for academic websites

This template is designed for researchers who want to build a simple academic website presenting their work.

It is **lightweight** and **portable**, since it only consists in a few PHP scripts (along with CSS styles, a bit of Javascript an a few optional external components). The only dependency is PHP (the code is currently tested with PHP 7.4 and 8.1), which is usually available on any web server.

It is **free** and **open**. The code was initially just the author's personal academic webpage, and this slightly improved and documented version is made available for anybody who wants to use it
